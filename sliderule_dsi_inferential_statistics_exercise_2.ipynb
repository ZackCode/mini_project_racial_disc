    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "   5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?\n",

    "3.I am not sure how to compute margin of error. For the call rate difference between balck and white, the actual value is 78, the 95% confidence interval using bootstrap is [41, 116], and p value is close to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.I conducted an analysis based on the given data, a total of 2435 black names and 2435 white names are used, and 157 black names get called, and 235 white names get called. The difference between them is 78, using bootstrap technic it is concluded that the 95% confidence interval for this value is [41, 116], and p value for the null hypotheses that race does not affect callback rate is 0 when simulated using permuation for ten thousand times, this indicates a high unlikely for null hyoitheses to stand, and race does influence the call back rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.With above being said, we cannot conclude the race/name is the most important factor in this experiment. For example, although the names are randomly assigned, it could be the case that resumes with white names have higher working experience on average than those with black names. In order to clarify this, I need to test the null hypotheses that resumes with white and black names have same distribution in other features (education, work experience, etc.)"
